	<b>Tweaks to Speed up your Router</b>
	</p>
	</center>

	<p>
	Tweaking router to speed up the internet is a requirement not only for home users, but also for startups, there are so many startups that initiate from homes, rented rooms or small spaces, garage, basement or backyard workshop. Even if you have 3 or more people working, its better tweak a little for an optimized internet speed for every user.
	</p>

	<p><b>Basics:</b></p>
	
	<p>The position of the router is important, The routers run on 2.4Ghz band, if possible always mount your router on the wall higher. The router needs to kept away from electrical and electronic appliances. even your bluetooth devices can affect the router’s reception, as they also work on the 2.4GHz band.</p>
	
	<p>Since most of the routers work on the 2.4GHz band, there’s too much crowd on that network and they start competing for reception. Many routers have an automatic setting, which detect the optimal network band (the least crowded one), but if its not, then you can test different channels by setting it in your router’s settings page.</p>
	
	<p><b>Boost your signal:</b></p>
	
	<p>Routers have their inbuilt antenna, but i surfed on the net and found people suggest third party antennas to strengthen the router’s signals. I’ll suggest before investing in third party antennas, do an experiment with economical aluminium foil antenna, have a look at these videos, Parabolic Homemade Reflector and wifi signal booster. This should surely help to increase the signal strength.</p>
	
	<p><b>Powerline Networking:</b></p>
	
	<p>This is something i have not tried, but planning to setup one, powerline networking adapters, they work at good speed without needing lengthy cables to be wired across the rooms. they just use your in house electrical wiring to transfer the data packets and they add no cost to your electricity bill. They are real easy, just plug-and-play kind of stuff and really helpful. I won’t suggest you the complete network AV kit, i found a lot of criticism and negative reviews about most of them, the basic wall-plug adapters would be enough, just go for that. anyone from the Netgear, TP-Link or Trendnet should be fine.</p>
	
	<p><b>Finally:</b></p>

	<p>Thats it for now on router tweaks for speed, securing the router is seriously important, you can’t ignore it. i’ll draft the tips and tweaks for security in my next post.</p>
