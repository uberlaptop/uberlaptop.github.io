	<b>Speed up your internet Select a faster DNS</b>
	</p>

	<p>
	The Domain Name System, I’ll not go into the theoretical details, but givng a brief, when you type any website name or any URL 	      in your browser’s address bar, it needs to be converted to an ip address, becuase this is what the computer, the router, 
	switch, network hub understand, the name or the url is for the human readability and easefulness. The DNS converts the 
	website-name to an ip address.
	</p>

	<p>
	selecting an appropriate DNS does make a lot of difference, it does speed up the browsing. usually the common suggesstion that I received is to use your ISP’s DNS, it would be the faster than any public DNS server. But my ISP’s DNS server is distressing, so i started trying and testing out the free public DNS servers available. For me, I found nortondns to be the fastest, the second was opendns and google third. Here I am sharing with you a few good public dns servers. Understand the DNS that helped me speed up my internet, might not be the one for you. For windows users, on your dos prompt you can do a ‘nslookup’, you’ll get the time the dns server took to resolve the website-name.
	</p>

	<p>
    <b>For example:	</b>
	</p>

	<p>
	> nslookup google.com 208.67.222.222	
	</p>
	
		<p>Similiarly for linux and mac users, you can run the ‘dig’ command from your shell prompt.</p>
		
		<p>$ dig @208.67.222.222 google.com</p>
		
		<p>
		Test with all the DNS servers ip addresses provided below, so to find out the fastest resolving server. Also test with your ISP’s dns server’s ip address, that may be the fastest one for you.

<p>
<ul>
<li>Norton: 
199.85.126.10 | 199.85.127.10
</li>
<li>OpenDNS:    
208.67.222.222 | 208.67.220.220
</li>
<li>Comodo: 
8.26.56.26 | 8.20.247.20
</li>
<li>DNSadvantage:
156.154.70.1 | 156.154.71.1
</li>
<li>Google:
8.8.8.8 | 8.8.4.4
</li>
<li>ScrubIT:
67.138.54.120 | 207.225.209.77
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Also I learnt that the unwanted ads that pop up on a web page or displayed on the sides, do eat away your bandwidth, what you can do is block these websites through your computer’s hosts file. For windows users you’ll need to add these in c:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts  for linux and Mac users you need to add it in your /etc/hosts file. I am sharing here a list of all the ad and malware sites. Also thanks to Dan Pollock, who shared a list on his website someonewhocares.org, that was really helpful. I added some more to Dan’s list as i found them while surfing the net. sharing the dropbox link below.
