	<b>Secure your Router</b>
	</p>
	</center>

	<p>As I mentioned in my previous post securing your router is really crucial, you shouldn’t ignore it. Already there have been lots of cases of hacking, where the intruders hacked into the wi-fi performed illegal activities and the innocent guy had to go through hardship. You just need to perform a few basic tweaks, and that should be sufficient.</p>
	
	<p><b>Basics: Set a hard password:</b></p>

<p>Change the default password, leaving the router set to a default password would be the biggest mistake, you need to set a tough password, alphanumeric, you can check your password’s strength at <a href="http://howsecureismypassword.net" target="_blank">HowSecureIsMyPassword</a>, you can get randomly generated password from Secure Password Generator and Random Password Generator. Before setting the password, note it down somewhere, as you and the other members who are on the same wifi network will need it. Suggestion, change the password once every week or atleast once every two weeks.</p>

	<p><b>Change the SSID Name:</b></p>

<p>The router’s SSID Name is either set to default or set to the brand name of the router. ex: ‘netgear’, change the default one and assign a name to it. This won’t help to improve the security, but you and the other memebers will be sure of connecting to the correct network. Don’t set the common names. Also Don’t set your name, any contact or personal info or address as the SSID name.</p>

	<p><b>Enable Encryption:</b></p>

<p>There are mutiple encryption methods available in your router’s wireless settings. WEP is the basic one, but its the least secure, so avoid using it. WPA2  (Wi-Fi Protected Access version 2) is the most secure encryption method. In your router’s configuration page, go to wireless security settings, select WPA2 security method, Enter a passphrase to access the network, again, set a tough alphanumeric passphrase, something that would be difficult to guess.</p>

	<p><b>Enable MAC address filtering:</b></p>

<p>Every device, mobiles, computers and networking equipments have a unique MAC address. Make a list of all the desktops, laptops and network devices that should be allowed to connect to your wireless network, get their MAC addresses and add them to MAC address filtering in your router’s administrative settings.</p>

	<p><b>Decrease the Signal range:</b></p>

<p>If you are working from a small space, workshop, garage or room, you can consider decreasing the signal range by changing the router’s mode to 802.11g or using a different wireless channel.</p>

	<p><b>Make sure the firmware’s updated:</b></p>

<p>You’ll have to check your router manufacturer’s website occasionally to make sure your router is running the latest updated firmware. You can find the existing firmware version in your router’s dashboard.</p>

	<p><b>Keep an eye on your network:</b></p>

<p>In your router’s administration page, look for DHCP client’s table, then go to Status, here you’ll see the list of all devices connected to your network, if you find any unknown connection, block it, change the router’s password immediately.</p>

	<p><b>Block unwanted sites with OpenDNS:</b></p>
	
	<p>you can sign up for the OpenDNS Home classic, which has customizable filtering. you can block adult sites, as well as any other partcular sites that you wish to block, you can add it in the settings -> Web Content Filtering page.</p>

	<p>Adding OpenDNS’s ip addresses in the router is much simpler. If not sure, you can refer to OpenDNS Router Setup page.</p>

	<p>ISP’s provide ip address through dhcp, the ip changes whenever you disconnect/reconnect or restart your router. Managing the dynamic ip addresses in opendns is easy. Once you register and verify your account with opendns, Add a network, go to the Advanced settings -> Enable Dynamic IP upate, you can read the detail info here -> Networks with Dynamic IP addresses. Install the opendns’s Dynamic IP Updater on any one of the computer in the network, make sure that computer is always on or turned on before the other computers log on to the network.</p>

	<p><b>Finally:</b></p>

<p>If you and the other members are on a leave, or on weekends, when no one’s coming to work, its better to switch off the router, this would save the electricity and also keep away the hackers and intruders.</p>
